A new CROC chip is used. Batch 008
Soft and Hardware version 2.


Setup:
	OLD CROC test board.
	Generator: Keysight 33600A Series Waveform Generator Trueform

Power supply:
	+12 V -> 190 mA
	-5 V -> 24 mA
	+3.3 V -> 0.01 A

Generator: (no attenuator is used)
	Signal: Pulse
	Freq: 90kHz
	High level: 5 mV
	Low level: 0.0 V
	Pulse width: 6 us
	Edge time (both): 2.9ns

	Burst mode: 1 Cycle

	Trigger: External source (the input is located in the back of the generator) from SMA out of FPGA
	Delay: 7.7us
	Slope: Rising
	Level: 1.0 V

	* With this generator and no attenuator the input signal seems a bit more stable in the oscilloscope. Moreover, I can separate the base from the signal level even in gain=4.

LabView 
	TimeSlice: CROC_GP_TrTSfile.txt
		measurement period (has 6 conversions) = 20us -> frequency = 50kHz
		TS1: nothing is active (1000, 2000, 300) ns
		TS2:
			delay: 1us
			clamp: 2us
			delay: 1+0.08us
			conv1: 720ns
			delay: 1us
			conv2: ...
			conv3: ...
			delay: 2us
			conv6: 720ns
			delay: 2us

	Settings:
		TS1 = 2000
		TS2 = 1
		conv = 6
		POL=POLIB=127
		NEN = V0 = ON

===============================================

Tests to do:
	for all 4 channels (all 4 are working well:
		in Transparent mode:
			1) input Noise vs gain: no input, the input is grounded with a 50Ohm resistor
			2) Offset scan: offset from 80 to max with a step of 5
			3) Absolute Gain (calibration): measure well the amplification factor on the BEB board 
			-> with the same dataset: output noise (ADU and volts) vs gain.  
		in DSI mode:
			1) input noise vs gain for different RC
			2) noise vs gain for diff RC:  
1) Input Noise, transparent mode, G=[5,10,...60,63]
	ALL channels together
	Offset=120

2) Pulse input, ch0, transparent mode
	measurement period = 20us (not sampling period, each measurement has 6 samples)
	the other 3 channels are at CF1 with noInput
	2kSamples, Offset=120

3) DSI mode, input noise
	2kSamples
	1us integration time (RU and RD each) with a window of 1us in between	
	here I have changed the generator settings but only delay width and frequency
	measurement period or sampling period = 15us

4) DSI mode, pulse input, chX
	the rest 3 channels at CF1 and RC=1
	2kSamples

5) F_BEB
	measurements in transparent mode and CF1 with pulse. 
	I have measured the differential output of Ch0 of the CROC amplitude before BEB with the oscilloscope.
		min=22.461mV
		max=22.852mV
	10 kSamples
