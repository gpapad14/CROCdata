2 parts: (A) measure the input signal amplitude with the oscilloscope 
	and (B) send pulses with different amplitude to the CROC.

A) Keysight 33600A Series waveform generator
Setup: Generator -> BNC cable to Oscilloscope with nothing else. 
	*I do not split the signal and send it to CROC.
	Filenames: INA"XX"F__.CSV
		XX = 3, 7, 9, 11 mV
		__ = nothing, 01, 02 (3 files for each value)
		time division scale = 2ms/square
		voltage div scale = 500uV (3mV), 1mV (7,9mV), 2mV (11mV)
		Generate pusle with the FPGA trigger as I do when I take measurements, so the period of the pulses is 20us even though the set frequency is 100kHz.
	I have taken before measurements for the input ampl 5mV

B) Setup: Generator -> BNC_to_SMA cable directly to CROC (no split on the oscilloscope)
	CROC->BEB_to_CROC->BEB->FPGA
	FPGA SMAout send the trigger pulse to generator.
	BEB power supply the same as always.

	Generator:
		freq set =100kHz -> actual input period 20us
		High lvl = 3, 5, 7, 9 mV
		Low lvl = 0V
		pulse width = 6us
		edge time = 2.9ns
		Burst option

	LabView: CROC_TEST2.vi
	Firmware: ...v2_TS1_TS2_1Mhz
	TS: ..._GP_TrTSfile.txt

	CROC LabView configuration
	Signal to only Ch0, rest NEN=on, CF1=OFF, Gain=0
	POL=POLIB=127
	Offset=120
	NEN=V1=Transp=ON

	TS1= 2200 samples
	TS2=1
	conv = 6 (6 points per sample)

	Input amplitude vs Gain
	3mV -> 10, 20, ... 50, 63	+ CF1
	5mV -> 5, 10, 20 ... 50, 63 + CF1
	7mV -> 5, 10, 20, ... 50,55 + CF1
	9mV -> 2, 10, 15, 20, [25], 30, 35 + CF1     * no measurement for 25, very bad
